## House of Vange iOS App

This app brings the spirit of [House of Vange](https://houseofvange.com/) (a performance/[brand](https://www.instagram.com/houseofvange/)/biz/troll/art project/experiment) right to the hands of the user. Features include authenticated users, virtual gallery of completed HOV pieces, user stats (how much $ they've invested and how many pieces they have purchased), performative ecommerce, a guestbook to sign, an almost endless scroll, and a live updating price.
Built with Google Firebase Firestore, SwiftUI, and Python.

## Project Status
The HOV app is in hibernation as it's not quite ready for primetime, but it does function!

## Reflection
This culminating project for Ada C16 was a blast to create. A challenging blast, but a blast no less. 

I learned 
- how to navigate Xcode
- write code in SwiftUI
- manage data on Firebase Firestore
- authenticate users with Firebase Auth
- import a csv file to firestore with a custom script
- transmute an art project to a new medium
- report progress to my group
- have compassion for myself after my app froze during the demo

Many many thanks to the Spruce gang <3 <3 <3
